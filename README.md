## 🌿 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student who believes that **technology is not just built — it’s grown, nurtured, and evolved**.  
Whether it's clean interfaces, smart logic, or ethical design — I strive for elegance and impact in every line of code I write.

💬 I code to connect  
🎨 I design to simplify  
🔍 I learn to empower

## 🧠 Core Beliefs

- 🧩 **Clarity before cleverness** — Code should be readable, not just runnable.  
- 🌱 **Simplicity is strength** — The most powerful solutions often feel obvious in hindsight.  
- 🤝 **Collaboration > competition** — Tech is a team sport.  
- 🌍 **Purpose fuels progress** — Good code changes lives, not just screens.

## ✨ What Drives Me

I’m inspired by **systems that feel human**, **designs that feel intuitive**, and **ideas that leave a mark**.  
From lines of code to lines of thought, I believe **clarity, empathy, and learning** are the foundations of engineering.

> _“I don’t just want to write code that works — I want to write code that matters.”_
